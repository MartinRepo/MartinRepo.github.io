I finally got maven installed, and the steps were generally easy, but I stepped in a few holes, I'll record them.

# Download APache Maven 

Website📡: [Apache-Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

Choose Binary zip archive and download it.

# Unzip the zip archive
I unzip it into /Libaray on my computer. 

# Configuration
``` bash
vi .bash_profile
```
Add 2 lines into this profile
```bash
export M2_HOME=/Library/apache-maven-3.8.7 // Or you can choose your own path and folder
export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin
```
Then, type ```:wq```, save and quit vim.

# Check if it is successful
```bash
(base) ******** ~ % mvn -verison

//If terminal output like this, congratulations!

Apache Maven 3.8.7 (b89d5959fcde851dcb1c8946a785a163f14e1e29)
Maven home: /Library/apache-maven-3.8.7
Java version: 1.8.0_301, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_301.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: UTF-8
```

# Some problem
Sometimes, it reports error that it could not find JAVAHOME. It is probably that the JAVA_HOME in the computer is wrong. 

Type command below to check jdk version

```bash
where java
```
Terminal would output a path if you do have java on the computer, then copy this command and type command below
```bash
vi .bash_profile
```
Replace the path in JAVA_HOME with your copies, then ```:wq```, finally
```bash
source .bash_profile

mvn -version
```
